# I Am Poor

A simple app called "I Am Poor" that was developed to test and apply the skills acquired during the development of the "I Am Rich" app. This app serves as a demonstration of the knowledge gained and showcases a different concept compared to its predecessor.

## Description

The "I Am Poor" app is a minimalist app that conveys the opposite sentiment of the "I Am Rich" app. It displays a humble coal image along with a reflective tagline that highlights the concept of simplicity and contentment. This app is a lighthearted reminder to appreciate the things we have in life.

## Features

- Humble coal image displayed on the screen.
- Reflective tagline emphasizing contentment.
- Clean and straightforward user interface.
- Smooth transitions for a pleasant user experience.

## Learning Journey

During the development of the "I Am Poor" app, I leveraged the skills and knowledge acquired from creating the "I Am Rich" app. Here are some ways in which I applied my previous learnings:

### Reusing Xcode and Storyboard Skills

Since both apps were developed using Xcode, I could apply my existing familiarity with the Xcode IDE and Storyboards. This allowed me to create and design the user interface efficiently, making use of the same tools, components, and techniques.

### Repurposing Design Elements

While the overall concept of the "I Am Poor" app is different, I reused certain design elements from the "I Am Rich" app. This helped maintain a consistent visual style and allowed me to focus on the aspects that differ between the two apps.

### Modifying Image Assets

To align with the theme of simplicity, I chose a coal image that symbolizes humbleness and scarcity. By modifying and resizing this image, I ensured that it conveys the intended message effectively. Similar to the "I Am Rich" app, I used the UIImageView component in the Storyboard to display the image within the app.

### Adapting UI Components

While the "I Am Poor" app shares some UI components with the "I Am Rich" app, such as labels and transitions, I made necessary adjustments to align them with the new app's purpose. This involved tweaking colors, text, and animations to create a unique user experience that suits the theme of simplicity.
